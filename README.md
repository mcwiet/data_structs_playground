# data_structs_playground
Practice area for implementing and using various data structures and algorithms.

Note that this repo may have some sub-par OOP practices (e.g. not always using interfaces where expected, repeated code). When convenient I try to reduce code duplication and generally try to comment in commit messages when something could have been better but I chose not to spend the time on it.
